    <!-- Solar -->
    <string name="solarLevel2Text">Solar panels transfer the sunâ€™s energy, which is in the form of electromagnetic radiation, into thermal energy to heat water for domestic and industrial purposes.</string>

    <!-- HeatPump -->
    <string name="heatpumpLevel2Text">An air source heat pump extracts heat from the surrounding air.  A fan draws the air over a heat exchanger coil known as an Evaporator.  The coil is filled with a cold refrigerant liquid. As the air flows over this coil, the cool liquid inside the coil draws heat from the air, and begins to heat up. This heat is later passed into a hot water storage tank located within the building, via a second heat exchanger known as a Condenser.</string>

    <!-- Biomass -->
    <string name="biomassLevel2Text">Biomass is a term used to identify fuels used in the renewable energy sector. These fuels include agricultural residues, energy crops and wood based crops.\n\nA wood pellet boiler (see left image from the GMIT Energy Lab) is fired on biological material (wood pellets) and is used to heat water. A gasification boiler (see right image from the GMIT Energy Lab) uses a syngas which is generated through the chemical reaction of burning wood and is also used to heat water.</string>

    <!-- Gas Boiler -->
    <string name="gasboilerLevel2Text">Condensing gas boilers use less fuel and have lower running costs than other boilers. Higher efficiency levels are made possible by extracting heat contained in the combustion gases, which would otherwise have been lost to the atmosphere.</string>
    <string name="btnGasBoilerOne">See video of gas boiler</string>
    <string name="btnGasBoilerTwo">System overview</string>
    
    <!-- Heat Transfer -->
    <string name="heattransferLevel2Text">The radiator system and the underfloor heating systems represent an excellent example of heat transfer. Heat transfer can occur through conduction, convection and radiation. All three systems are represented in the GMIT Energy lab. Heat transfer only occurs when there is a temperature gradient, i.e. heat energy flows from a high temperature region to a low temperature region.</string>
