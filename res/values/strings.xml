    <!-- Solar Overview -->
    <string name="solarTitlePin1">Inlet temperature</string>
    <string name="solarTitlePin2">Outlet temperature</string>

    <string name="solarTitlePin9">Hot water storage tank</string>
    <string name="solarTitlePin10">Solar radiation</string>
    
    <string name="solarMessagePin1">The inlet temperature sensor measures the temperature of the incoming (cold) water to the collector. It is only needed during testing and is not a standard part of a domestic solar thermal system.</string>
    <string name="solarMessagePin2">The outlet temperature sensor measures the temperature of the outgoing (heated) water from the collector.  When the outgoing water temperature reaches a set temperature compared with that pre-set at the top of the storage tank, the circulation pump is activated. When the temperature difference goes below a pre-set value, the pump de-activates.</string>
    <string name="solarMessagePin3">The best place to put a solar thermal collector is on a south-facing roof. This is where it will get most sun. The solar panels act like a window.  They let in the sun’s energy and it is taken up by the solar thermal system. The typical domestic home uses either flat plate or evacuated tube collectors. The diagram presents the flat plate collector in GMIT Energy lab.</string>
    <string name="solarMessagePin4">The system controller turns on/off the circulating pump, based on the reading from the solar collector outlet temperature.</string>
    <string name="solarMessagePin5">The expansion tank allows the water in the system to expand due to water temperature rise.</string>
    <string name="solarMessagePin6">The pressure gauge shows the pressure of the fluid in the pipes of the solar collector system.</string>
    <string name="solarMessagePin7">This is the temperature of the water coming from the coil in the multi-energy tank. The hot water in the pipe coming from the solar panels is transferred from the inlet pipe to heat the water in the tank.</string>
    <string name="solarMessagePin8">This is the temperature of the water coming from the solar panel minus the temperature losses occurring in the pipework between the solar panel and the tank. To reduce these losses, use ‘class 0’ high temperature insulation.</string>
    <string name="solarMessagePin9">The basic solar thermal system has a dual coil cylinder as the storage tank. A dual coil cylinder basically has two coils: a coil for the solar thermal system and a coil for the auxiliary heating system. The circulating pump for the solar system sends the hot water from the solar panels through the lower coil.  The heat from the solar collector is transferred into the tank, ready for use. On a dull day, when there is not much sun,  the second coil is used to heat the tank, via an auxiliary heating system, typically an oil, gas or biomass fuelled boiler.</string>
    <string name="solarMessagePin10">The sun provides energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The average direct solar radiation in Ireland is 2.6kWh/m2/day, which is quite good considering the large number of cloudy, overcast days. Solar panels can provide on average 60\u0025 of domestic hot water in winter and usually 100\u0025 in summer.</string>
         
    <!-- HeatPump -->
    <string name="heatpumpLevel2Text">An air source heat pump extracts heat from the surrounding air.  A fan draws the air over a heat exchanger coil known as an Evaporator.  The coil is filled with a cold refrigerant liquid. As the air flows over this coil, the cool liquid inside the coil draws heat from the air, and begins to heat up. This heat is later passed into a hot water storage tank located within the building, via a second heat exchanger known as a Condenser.</string>

    <string name="heatpumpTitlePin9">Cold return flow</string>
    <string name="heatpumpTitlePin10">Multi-energy tank</string>
    
    <string name="heatpumpMessagePin1">The air outside the building. The heat pump in the GMIT Energy Lab draws heat energy from a large volume of air outside and transforms it into a lower volume of hot water inside.</string>
    <string name="heatpumpMessagePin2">The evaporator uses a fan to draw air from the surroundings over tubes containing refrigerant.  Since the air is warmer than the refrigerant in the tubes, heat is transferred from the ‘warm’ air (even at or below 0oC) to the colder refrigerant. This causes the cold refrigerant liquid to evaporate, and turn into a gas.</string>
    <string name="heatpumpMessagePin3">The compressor, driven by an electric motor, acts like a pump, pushing the refrigerant about the circuit. It also increases both the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant vapour.</string>
    <string name="heatpumpMessagePin4">The hot vapour from the compressor now enters the condenser and, as it condenses from a vapour to a liquid, gives off heat to the water from the water storage tank. The heated water flows back into the multi-energy tank where it is stored for domestic use.</string>
    <string name="heatpumpMessagePin5">Receiver tank for temporary storage of the refrigerant.</string>
    <string name="heatpumpMessagePin6">The refrigerant moves on from the condenser to a receiver tank for temporary storage, before demand draws it through the expansion valve, where its temperature and pressure both decrease. It then returns to the evaporator and the cycle is repeated.</string>
    <string name="heatpumpMessagePin7">Switch for heat/cool mode. The heat pump can work also in air conditioning mode (providing cool air). This switch makes the system work in reverse mode (transfers heat from water to air).</string>

    <!-- Biomass -->
    <string name="biomassLevel2Text">Biomass is a term used to identify fuels used in the renewable energy sector. These fuels include agricultural residues, energy crops and wood based crops.\n\nA wood pellet boiler (see left image from the GMIT Energy Lab) is fired on biological material (wood pellets) and is used to heat water. A gasification boiler (see right image from the GMIT Energy Lab) uses a syngas which is generated through the chemical reaction of burning wood and is also used to heat water.</string>

    <string name="woodgasificationMessagePin1">The oxygen sensor measures the difference between exhaust gas mixture and the external air. The lambda sensor is extremely important, as it is used to control the air inlet valve, thereby achieving an optimum environment for combustion.</string>
    <string name="woodgasificationMessagePin2">The induced draft ventilator is fitted to the flue gas connection and operates via an electric motor. The boiler needs the fan to draw the gases generated in the first combustion chamber into the secondary combustion chamber, where they are burned at a very high temperature.</string>
    <string name="woodgasificationMessagePin3">This is the main chamber in the boiler where the boiler is filled with logs, the logs are ignited, and initial combustion of the wood takes place. Depending on the type of wood used, the boiler can hold between 36-55kg of wood.</string>
    <string name="woodgasificationMessagePin4">Small baffles are inserted into the boiler heat exchanger to agitate the air providing better heat transfer to the boiler hence increasing the efficiency of the boiler.</string>
    <string name="woodgasificationMessagePin5">A mixing valve is connected to the flow and return pipe work. This ensures that water temperature in the pipe going back to the boiler is high enough to prevent condensation of flue gases in the boiler. This keeps the boiler running more efficiently. A three-way valve permits flow and return water to be mixed in the proportions necessary to keep the water going back to the boiler at the desired temperature.</string>
    <string name="woodgasificationMessagePin6">The boiler’s control panel is fixed to the top surface of the boiler. It allows the user to set key performance values for the efficient operation of the boiler.</string>

    <string name="woodpelletMessagePin7">Contains the ignition elements, photo cell, internal auger, and fan. The burner unit receives pellets from the external auger. The burner is fed pellets by connecting the thermoplastic hose to the top of the combustion unit and the other side to the external auger.</string>

    <string name="woodpelletMessagePin11">Allows water to expand when heated.</string>
    <string name="woodpelletMessagePin12">The purpose of the flue is to generate a draught that will transport smoke and fumes away from the point of combustion. The draught in the flue is determined by outside temperature, boiler capacity, exhaust gas temperature, chimney height and outside wind conditions. As conditions change, the draught can easily vary from 0 to 100Pa. Wood pellet boilers are most efficient when the negative pressure in the flue ranges from 0 to 20Pa. A motorised flue fan has been installed in the Energy Lab to assist in maintaining this pressure differential.</string>
    <string name="woodpelletMessagePin13">The 3‐way thermostatic mixing valve ensures the return temperature to the boiler is hot enough to prevent condensation of the flue gases in the boiler chamber.</string>

    <!-- Gas Boiler -->
    <string name="gasboilerLevel2Text">Condensing gas boilers use less fuel and have lower running costs than other boilers. Higher efficiency levels are made possible by extracting heat contained in the combustion gases, which would otherwise have been lost to the atmosphere.</string>

    <string name="gasboilerMessagePin1">The boiler is a room sealed boiler.  A fan draws out the combustion fumes, and discharges them directly outside through the central core of a circular, concentric flue, around which air is drawn in and passed to the combustion chamber of the boiler.</string>
    <string name="gasboilerMessagePin2">This is a passive flue gas heat recovery device. The gas saver is easily installed between the boiler and flue. It stores the condensate (5.5L) normally expelled into the atmosphere through the boiler flue.  The heat from this condensate is used to pre-heat water coming into the boiler base from the cold mains supply. This significantly increases efficiency of the condensing boiler to greater than 91\u0025.</string>
    <string name="gasboilerMessagePin3">Gas boiler air inlet and exhaust gas outlet.</string>
    <string name="gasboilerMessagePin4">The gas boiler installed in the Energy Lab is an Alpha CD25C high efficiency, condensing, combination boiler designed to use propane gas only. The boiler has an efficiency of 91.9\u0025. As it is a ‘combi’ boiler, it is therefore capable of providing both central heating and domestic hot water at mains pressure.</string>
    <string name="gasboilerMessagePin5">This controls the operational efficiency of the boiler by allowing the user to adjust key performance parameters.</string>
    <string name="gasboilerMessagePin6">In order to determine the efficiency of the boiler, the rate of propane being consumed is monitored using a gas meter.</string>
    <string name="gasboilerMessagePin7">The condensate produced by the boiler is usually acidic, and has to be piped to a drain. The heat exchanger of the boiler must be of very high quality to prevent corrosion by the acid.</string>
    <string name="gasboilerMessagePin8">A 3-way valve mixes some cold water with hot water on the return, thus preventing thermal shock and condensation on the outside of the boiler plate.</string>

    <!-- Heat Transfer -->
    <string name="heattransferLevel2Text">The radiator system and the underfloor heating systems represent an excellent example of heat transfer. Heat transfer can occur through conduction, convection and radiation. All three systems are represented in the GMIT Energy lab. Heat transfer only occurs when there is a temperature gradient, i.e. heat energy flows from a high temperature region to a low temperature region.</string>

    <string name="underfloorMessagePin1">The basic solar thermal system incorporates a dual-coil cylinder as the storage tank. A dual coil cylinder basically has two coils: a coil for the solar thermal system and a coil for the auxiliary heating system. The circulating pump circulates the heat transfer fluid through the lower coil. In turn, the heat from the solar collector is transferred into the tank, ready for use. On a day of low incoming solar radiation, the second coil is used to heat the tank, via an auxiliary heating system, typically an oil, gas or biomass fuelled boiler.</string>
    <string name="underfloorMessagePin2">Temperature-controlled 3-port mixing valve. The temperature needed for underfloor heating in standard domestic installations is 35-40C. Water returns to the bottom of the multi-energy tank only when the temperature drops below this value (pre-set). Alternately, the water circulates to the supply manifold.</string>
    <string name="underfloorMessagePin3">The circulation pump circulates water through the manifolds to the individual underfloor heating system. The pump has three speed settings.</string>
    <string name="underfloorMessagePin4">Electrically (solenoid) operated flow valves to allow the user to activate each underfloor loop using the control system. These solenoid-operated valves would be used to control zones in a domestic installation where a temperature controller (room stat) would activate the solenoid.</string>
    <string name="underfloorMessagePin5">Supply manifold for four-zone underfloor heating system.</string>
    <string name="underfloorMessagePin6">Flow control valves and visual flow meters on the return manifold to balance the flow to each circuit (underfloor loop).</string>
