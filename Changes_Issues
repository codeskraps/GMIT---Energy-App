Possible Changes/Issues:

1.- Context menu on launcherActivity ?

My launcherActivity is the one that Aurora called
"About lvl 1", I renamed it for consistency.

Will I add a menu on this Activity ? This activity
is the only one that doesn't have a menu at the 
moment. It didn't seem that it needed one because
the avility to launch all other menu option from
that activity but perhaps would be better adding
it for consistency through out the app

2.- Added About menu option

In Aurora's document she didn't add the about
option in the menu but I think there should be
the option to launch the aboutActivity from
the menu.

3.- Added Preferences

to review on first milestone if preferenes are ok
add more or remove them ?

4.- All images removed background color

Android wasn't given me a nice contrast with the
icons white background color, so I removed all 
the background colors to transparent where possible

5.- Issue, webview of engineering activity title

I'm able to change the title of the activity to whatever the
user clicks to but I'm not able to do the same on back button

Possibility store all the urls and use them that way but this
would take a lot of work.

6.- Possible change

I would perhaps remove the welcome screen and join the
welcome screen with the about screen into one.

7.- Add splash screen

I hope you like this small addition
