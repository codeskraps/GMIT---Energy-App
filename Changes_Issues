Possible Changes/Issues:

1.- Context menu on launcherActivity ?

My launcherActivity is the one that Aurora called
"About lvl 1", I renamed it for consistency.

Will I add a menu on this Activity ? This activity
is the only one that doesn't have a menu at the 
moment. It didn't seem that it needed one because
the avility to launch all other menu option from
that activity but perhaps would be better adding
it for consistency through out the app

2.- About option in Context menu ?

In Aurora's document she didn't add the about
option in the menu but I think there should be
the option to launch the aboutActivity from
the menu.
